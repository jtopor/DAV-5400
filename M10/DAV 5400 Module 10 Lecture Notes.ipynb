    "\n",
    "Hadley Wickham defines \"tidy data\" as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each variable forms a column that contains values specific to that variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each observation forms a row\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each type of *observational unit* forms a table\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A __variable__ contains all values that measure the same underlying attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "An __observation__ contains all values measured across attributes for a single \"unit\", __where the \"unit\" of observation is defined by your domain knowledge for the given data set__. (In other words, it is up to __you__ as a data analytics practitioner to specify how a valid observation should be defined for the data you are working with, and you need to use your __domain knowledge__ to help you come up with your definition of what constitutes a single __\"observation\"__.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\\*\\* Note that __multiple variables may be part of a single 'tidy' observation__ \\*\\*: For example, a weather observation taken at a specific time of day might include measurements such as temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, and cloud cover.  The fact that they are all recorded together does not mean that the individual variable values need to be stored in separate rows. As long as they are housed within distinct columns and labeled properly, we can have multiple variables within a single 'tidy' observation.\n",
