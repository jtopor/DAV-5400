    "- __Create \"Interaction\" Features__: Interaction features are new metrics we __derive__ from our existing data (NOTE: we've already touched on this concept this semester).Examples include creating new ratios / proportions from our existing data as well as binning / bucketing of numeric data and the de-structuring of date / time values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Combining Sparse Classifications__: With categorical data, \"sparse classes\" are those that have very few observations within a particular categorical variable. Such \"sparse data\" can cause problems with a wide variety of predictive and machine learning models (e.g., causing the models to \"overfit\" the data use for model training purposes).  These challenges can oftentimes be overcome by combining sparse classes into new classifications that aggregate the sparse items based on some shared characteristic(s). How you identify such \"shared characteristics\" is highly subjective, i.e., you need to apply your __domain knowledge__ to identify them. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Adding \"Dummy\" Variables__: As we've previously discussed, we cannot use raw categorical data as input to a model that requires numerical data. Instead, we create a new \"0/1\" binary indicator variable for each categorical data value.\n",

    "- Converting categorical values to digits __DOES NOT__ change the fact that the contents of the variable are CATEGORICAL. Converting categorical values to digits is simply a \"renaming\" of the categorical values and in the resulting digits have no more meaning for mathematical calculation purposes than do the original character-based categorical values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Correlation metrics __CANNOT__ be derived from raw categorical data (whether in string or digit format). When performing EDA work with categorical data it is best to make use of bar plots for purposes of understanding the relationship between categorical explanatory variables and the given response variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dummy variables are derived from explanatory variables for purposes of model building. Failure to make use of dummy variables will result in your models being invalid."

    "\n",
    "### What is \"Data Ethics\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- According to Wikipedia __data ethics__ \"..refers to systemising, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong conduct in relation to data, in particular personal data.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Specifically, __individual rights__ (e.g., right to privacy, right to consent, etc.) should __always__ take precedence over institutional or commericial interests.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ideally, the practice of \"__Data Ethics__\" should apply to all collectors and disseminators of structured or unstructured data such as data analytics professionals, data brokers, governments, and large corporations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### So what are the guiding principles of data ethics?\n",
    "\n",
    "According to __dataethics.eu__ (https://dataethics.eu/data-ethics-principles/):\n",
    "\n",
    "- __INDIVIDUAL DATA CONTROL__: Humans should be in control of and empowered by their data. The individual has the primary control over the usage of their data, the context in which his/her data is processed and how it is activated.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __TRANSPARENCY__: The purpose of and ways in which data is being processed must be fully transparent and explainable to the individual, including any potential risks to the individual such as economic, privacy, social, ethical, or societal consequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __ACCOUNTABILITY__: All collectors and disseminators of structured and unstructured data should have guidelines in place to ensure that any use of personal data adheres to ethical data usage practices, and should ensure that such guidelines are honored by subcontractors. Furthermore, all collectors and disseminators of structured and unstructured data should ensure they have appropriate controls and systems in place to prevent hacking of the data they have amassed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __EQUALITY__: All personal data should be treated in a consistent manner without adversely affecting any individual's self-determination and control of their personal information, and should not expose any individual to discrimination or stigmatisation, for example due to their financial, social or health related conditions.\n",
    "\n",

    "- A key aspect of ethical statistical practice is __making your original data available for others to work with__. \n",

    "\n",
    "What is \"disparate impact\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Disparate Impact is a form of indirect and often unintentional discrimination whereby certain criteria disproportionately favor certain groups over other groups. Disparate impact occurs when what appears to be a neutral policy, rule, or practice has a disproportionate negative impact on members of a protected class (e.g., in the USA that includes minorities, the disabled, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A strength requirement might screen out disproportionate numbers of female applicants for a job\n",
    "\n",
    "- Requiring all applicants for promotion to receive a certain score on a standardized test could adversely affect candidates of color.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, almost every selection methodology used by employers produces a degree of disparate impact because each methodology disproportionately excludes members of a protected group. Basic selection criteria such as background checks, credit checks, work experience, pre-employment tests, and minimum educational requirements can all lead to disparate impact if you subscribe to that theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So how is disparate impact proven? __Using statistical analysis__\n",

    "- The statistical analyses used are often simplistic and often purposely refuse to consider the effects of possible confounding variables.\n",

    "\n",
    "What do these examples have in common? Should the statistical analyses have been required to consider confounding variables?\n",

    "\n",
    "- What about the criminals? Are minorities being unfairly singled out for exclusion from apartment rentals? Is it legitimate for landlords and residents to want to prohibit people convicted of violent crimes from living in the same building or development? What other confounding variables should be considered when determining whether minorities are being unfairly singled out in this situation?\n",
